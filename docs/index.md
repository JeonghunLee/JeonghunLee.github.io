## Interests         

<br/>

I am especially interested in Embedded Firmware, BSP (Linux, RTOS), and DSP systems,    
with a strong focus on system-level integration and debugging.   

I tend to focus on solving integration-level problems between hardware, firmware, and software,     
where timing, reliability, and cross-domain interactions are critical.

* **Primary Technical Blog (Blogger)**  
:fontawesome-brands-blogger:  https://ahyuo79.blogspot.com   

My main technical portfolio, documenting **system-level embedded engineering**      
thhrough real-world implementation and in-depth   analysis, including:          
  * [Linux](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-bsp-yocto) / [RTOS](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-bsp-sram) / Bare-Metal [BSP bring-up](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-bsp-bringup)   
  * [Embedded firmware](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-bsp-main) & [low-level debugging](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-bsp-debug)   
  * DSP, [RF and Radar-related system](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-rf) analysis and [AI/Edge AI](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-ai)   
  * Embedded [Security System](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-security) , [DevOps](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-devops) and [professional IDE toolchains](project_technical_skills.md#technical-blog-ide)      
  → **[Technical Skills](project_technical_skills.md)**  

??? note "Primary Technical Blog"    
    This blog documents system-level investigations across HW, FW, OS, and DSP,   
    focusing on debugging processes, design trade-offs, and real-world constraints.  

??? tip "Language and Tags support"    
    The blog is primarily written in Korean, with **English support available via Google Translate**.    
    All links redirect to my technical blog (Blogger), organized using **tag-based categories**    

<br/>

* **Secondary Technical Blog (Medium)**  
:fontawesome-brands-medium: https://medium.com/@ahyuo79   

??? note "Secondary Technical Blog"   
    Selected topics from **primary technical blog** are refined and expanded for a broader, international audience.

## Communities  

<br/>

* 🌍 **Communities**     
Actively participating in global semiconductor & embedded engineering communities     
(using my **private email / private ID(ahyuo79)**):   
    * [NXP Community](http://community.nxp.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/181710)   
    * [NVIDIA Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/u/ahyuo79/activity)   
    * [TI E2E Forum](https://e2e.ti.com/members/1028408/activities)  


??? note "Community Preference"   
    I value engineering cultures that focus on open technical discussion,    
    documentation, and reference designs as core parts of the development process.       
    I also take part in various engineering communities and local meetups to exchange ideas and learn from different perspectives
