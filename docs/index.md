## Interests         

<br/>

I am especially interested in Embedded Firmware, BSP (Linux, RTOS), and DSP systems,    
with a strong focus on system-level integration and debugging.   

I tend to focus on solving integration-level problems between hardware, firmware, and software,     
where timing, reliability, and cross-domain interactions are critical.

## Communities  

<br/>
<br/>

* 🌍 **Communities**     
Actively participating in global semiconductor & embedded engineering communities     
(using my **private email / private ID(ahyuo79)**):   
    * [NXP Community](http://community.nxp.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/181710)   
    * [NVIDIA Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/u/ahyuo79/activity)   
    * [TI E2E Forum](https://e2e.ti.com/members/1028408/activities)  


??? note "Community Preference"   
    I value engineering cultures that focus on open technical discussion,    
    documentation, and reference designs as core parts of the development process.       
    I also take part in various engineering communities and local meetups to exchange ideas and learn from different perspectives
